        <h2>About F1 in Schools</h2>
        <p>F1 in Schools by Yas in Schools is an educational program that aims to engage students in the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) through the exciting context of Formula 1 racing. It is part of a global initiative designed to help students understand the complexities of designing and engineering a race car. Here's a breakdown of what the program typically involves:
            <ol>
                <li> <b>Team Formation:</b> Students form teams, each assuming roles similar to those in a professional Formula 1 team, such as Team Manager, Design Engineer, Manufacturing Engineer, and Marketing Manager. </li>
                <li> <b>Car Design and Manufacturing:</b> Using CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software, students design miniature F1 cars. These cars are then manufactured using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines, often from lightweight materials like balsa wood. </li>
                <li> <b>Testing and Racing:</b> The teams test their cars and make iterative improvements to enhance performance. The final cars are raced on a track using CO2 cartridges as propulsion, simulating the speed and excitement of a real Formula 1 race. </li>
                <li> <b>Business and Marketing:</b> Teams also develop a business plan and marketing strategy, which includes seeking sponsorships, managing budgets, and promoting their team and car. </li>
                <li> <b>Competitions:</b> Teams compete at various levels, starting from regional competitions and potentially advancing to national and even international championships. These competitions evaluate not only the speed of the cars but also the quality of the engineering, design, marketing, and teamwork. </li>
                <li> <b>Learning and Skill Development:</b> The program provides practical experience in STEM subjects, project management, problem-solving, and communication skills, preparing students for future careers in engineering, technology, and business. </li>
            </ol>
            Yas in Schools specifically targets students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and is part of the broader efforts by Yas Marina Circuit to promote motorsport education and engagement in the region. The initiative aims to inspire the next generation of engineers, scientists, and innovators by leveraging the thrilling world of Formula 1 racing.
